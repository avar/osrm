- extractorLargeNetwork finishes with: 
  terminate called after throwing an instance of 'stxxl::resource_error'
  what():  Error in function void stxxl::mutex::lock() pthread_mutex_lock(&_mutex) Invalid argument

  This ist a known, albeit odd behavior that is caused by a bug in stxxl. It can be ignored. Upgrade
  to version 1.3.1 of stxxl.
