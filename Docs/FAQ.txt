Q: What platforms does OSMR run on?
A: Virtually any Unix-like platform with g++ installed. It has been developed
   under Linux and tested on MacOS X 10.6. It should run under Windows as well
   though the code will need some adjustments.
   
Q: What is the workflow to get the engine up and running
A: Road network extraction->Preprocessing->Startup 

Q: What does OSRM stand for?
A: It is an abbreviation for Open Source Routing Machine.

Q: What does HSGR stand for?
A: It is an abbreviation for Hierarchy Search GRaph.

Q: What is the .nodes file?
A: It is a map that translates between internal and external Node IDs. Remember
   that external NodeIDs can be arbitrary and non-contigous. Internally the
   nodes are numbered from 0 to n-1.

Q: The routing engine crashes with a seg-fault
A: Check the startup parameters.

Q: Something about the route is odd. I know that there is a better path
A: Most probably it is missing data in the OSM file.

Q: I work for this company that would like to use the code, but we are hesistant
   because of the license.
A: Contact me. Probably, we can work something out.

Q: How fast is this thing?
A: Good question. Here is a number. The engine was able to handle more than
   2800 requests per Minute on the German road network with the travel time
   metric on a Core 2 Duo. This also includes transfer of data across a 
   switched 100MBit/s LAN. So, I guess it's fair to say it's fast.
